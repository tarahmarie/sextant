SEXTANT INFLUENCE DETECTION: COMPARING HIGH VS LOW SCORING PAIRS
==========================================================================================

This report compares what Sextant 'sees' in a high-influence case versus
a low-influence case, demonstrating that the model detects meaningful
vocabulary clustering, not just raw word overlap.

KEY INSIGHT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross→Conrad has MORE shared hapaxes (174 vs 31) but scores LOW because:
  • Similar chapter lengths mean more overlap expected by chance
  • Shared words are generic prose vocabulary, not thematically distinctive

Eliot→Lawrence has FEWER shared hapaxes but scores HIGH because:
  • 24:1 word count ratio makes ANY overlap remarkable
  • Shared words cluster around psychological interiority
  • This matches Lawrence's stated debt: 'putting all the action inside'

CONCLUSION FOR PAPER
==========================================================================================

The contrast demonstrates Sextant's core claim: it detects meaningful
vocabulary absorption, not coincidental overlap. High-scoring pairs share
thematically coherent rare vocabulary; low-scoring pairs share only generic
prose words despite having more raw overlap. The Jaccard normalization and
z-score combination correctly identify concentrated, distinctive vocabulary
similarity as more significant than diffuse, generic similarity.

Suggested paper text:

  "Comparing anchor and negative cases reveals what Sextant detects. The
   Eliot→Lawrence pairing (99.97th percentile) shares 31 hapaxes despite
   a 24:1 word count ratio; these cluster around psychological interiority
   (overwrought, revelation, agitation, inwardly). The Cross→Conrad pairing
   (24.65th percentile) shares 174 hapaxes at similar chapter lengths, but
   these are generic prose vocabulary (descriptions, immediately, approached)
   with no thematic coherence. Sextant correctly identifies concentrated,
   distinctive vocabulary overlap as more significant than diffuse, generic
   overlap."
